# Code Challenge - Exploring jQuery Methods

This challenge asks that you work in teams to select buttons to add click events triggering ta variety of jquery methods on corresponding paragraphs and elements in the page.

## Tasks

1. Fork this repository.
2. Clone your fork.
3. cd into local folder for this challenge.
4. In the js/methods.js file lookup each method labeled in a comment for example you can lookup the usage for `//hide` at `http://api.jquery.com/hide`.
5. Select each button from the index.html page that is labeled with an id number for example `#b1` and use the click event method to write the code necessary to trigger the paragraph (in index.html) below the button to behave as the button is labeled for example `#b1` should `.hide()` paragraph 1 `#p1`. The first example is filled in. Repeat this for all remaining buttons and targeted elements. As a reference you can see a live code example [here](http://learn-co-curriculum.github.io/fe-jquery-exploring-methods/)
